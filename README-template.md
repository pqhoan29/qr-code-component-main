## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have known a several ways to center a div.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="background">
    <div class="container">...</div>
</div>
```

```css
.background {
    width: 1440px;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    margin: 0 auto;
    position: relative;
    box-shadow: 5px 10px 60px -10px grey;
}

.container {
    width: 330px;
    height: 500px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-top: -250px;
    margin-left: -165px;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```
